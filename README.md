# Wine Data Analysis with Feature Scaling

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores and analyzes a wine dataset with a focus on feature scaling and data normalization techniques. The dataset includes features like "Class label," "Alcohol," and "Malic acid."

## Contents

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** 
  - We start by loading the wine dataset and renaming the columns for clarity.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
  - The notebook provides an initial exploration of the dataset, including visualizations and summary statistics.
  
- **Feature Scaling:** 
  - Various scaling techniques, such as Min-Max Scaling, are applied to the dataset to normalize the features, ensuring the data is prepared for machine learning models.
